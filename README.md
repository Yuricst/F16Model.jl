# F16Model
Nonlinear model of F16 flight dynamics.

See src/testF16Model.jl for usage. 
The dynamics and linearization is functional and can be used for control law design and simulations. 

## Problem
Having problem with FileIO/JLD inside package. Problems with precompilation.
Works fine outside package. 

## To do:
1. Trim functions
2. Aero-table plotting
